This is the README file for Project 3.


What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in healthy individuals?

What is the rate of memory decline based on these measures over the aging process in those diagnosed with MCI/dementia during the study?

Is there a period of time before the diagnosis of MCI/dementia in which the rate of the memory decline changes (or accelerates)?

Longterm goal: biomarkers Short term: what is noticeable compared to aging process


DATA NOTES:
SES continuos SES status 
MCI: age of onset for MCI - 2055 no MCI, 


OUTCOMES: 
(1) the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory I Story A (logmemI) 
(2) Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II Story A (logmemII) 
(3) category fluency for animals (animals)
(4) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Block Design (blockR)
		
GROUP: demind (dementia score) or CDR score? Need two consecutive CDRS > 0.5 to be classified as developing a MCI

Data management ?s:
389 vs. 156 
is demind valid?
