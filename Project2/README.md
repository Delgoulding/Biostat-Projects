This is the README file for Project 2.

Data received from 44 VA hospitals (labeled hospcode).
VA investigators want to know if the death rate (death30) is unusually high OR low. 

Primary goal/ question: What is the observed death rate from surgery at each hospital for the most recent 6 month period?  

Data Notes:
3 years of past data to help develop hospital adjusted estimates of expected risk
BMI, height, weight gathered
Health @ procedure start recording (1good, 5bad)
Types of heart surgery (2)

Data Plan:
Make a risk-rate per six-month per 44 hospitals
Compare risk rates
