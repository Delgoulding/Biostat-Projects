This is the repository for DeLayna Goulding. 


These folders will be used for BIOS 6623 projects.


I followed the instructions on canvas to set up and add BIOS6623 to my repository. I used the local drive to write this read me. I then pushed and pulled successfully with GitLraken to have this readme on my GitHub. I am still unsure of what I want to include in my commit summary and description.
